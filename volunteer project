Pass the Peas is a non-profit organization that was created by 
students who had a vision of making the world a better place. The founders of the organization all used to work at fast food restaurants and have an 
understanding as to how food is handled.The goal of the organization is to prevent the unnecessary waste of 
food and pass it on to those who really need it. Volunteers of Pass the Peas will go around 
to different food companies and take the food that was left behind by negligent customers or
wrong orders,that usually gets thrown away at the end of the night, and donate it to homeless 
shelters. This ensures that food isn't thrown away and that those who really need it will 
have the opportunity to actually receive it. Before the food is passed down, we will guarantee that the
food isn't in bad condition and is safe to consume. This site was conctructed so that willing companies 
would join and participate with their food donations. It also has an area for intrigued individuals 
to make donations or sign-up to be volunteers.
